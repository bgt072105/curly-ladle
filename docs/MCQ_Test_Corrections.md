## Finals Quiz 1
### Score: 46/50

### Test Corrections:

Q 20 - I picked option B, but option A was correct because when list1 and list2 are combined, the newList may have duplicates and will likely not be sorted. By performing the Sort and then the RemoveDuplicates procedures it is possible to create a list that is sorted, has no duplicates, and contains the names of all the books found in either list1 or list2.

Q 25 - I picked option A, but option C was correct because the Creative Commons license is designed to increase the amount of content available to the public for free which means that Statement I is correct. Furthermore, statement III is correct because under Creative Commons the author can stipulate what kind of modification is allowed by users.

Q 32 - I picked option B, but option C was correct because moving the statement in line 5 so that it appears between lines 2 and 3 would allow count to be initialized outside of the for loop.

Q 37 - I picked option B, but option D was correct because when x=3, y=2, and z=1 the program would not find the max to be 3, which is the value of x.

### Score: 49/50

### Test Corrections:

Q 45 - I picked option C, but option A was correct because Spreadsheet II was necessary to determine which kids played sports. Once that was determined, spreadsheet I could be used to compare the GPAs of kids that played sports and kids that didn't play any sports.

### Test Corrections:

Q 3 - I picked option D, but option B was correct because algorithm I does not work correctly. In algorithm I, if two people are tied for the earliest birthday, they both sit down when they are eventually paired. Algorithm II works correctly. Because algorithm II allows both people to remain standing when there is a tie, a person with the earliest birthday is not eliminated. Algorithm II continues until all remaining people have the same birthday, which is the earliest birthday. Algorithm III does not work correctly. Algorithm III chooses the person(s) with the earliest day, disregarding the month. For example, algorithm III will incorrectly determine that a person born on February 1 has an earlier birthday than a person born on January 5.

Q 6 - I picked options A and C but the correct answer was options A and D because for option D the algorithm displays the numbers 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, and 20. After 20 is displayed, x is incremented to 21. The value 21 is not displayed since it is a multiple of 3 and the algorithm terminates. Option C is not correct because This algorithm displays the numbers 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, and 19. The number 20 is not displayed since the algorithm terminates immediately after x is assigned the value 20.

Q 8 - I pickeds option B, but option D was correct because the algorithm in option D selects 1 student from the group of 30 students, then selects another student from the remaining 29 students. Any possible pair of students is equally likely to be selected.

Q 41 - I picked option A, but option D was correct because in public cryptography, a message is encrypted with a recipient’s public key and decrypted with the recipient’s private key.

Q 16 - I picked option C, but option A is correct because program A initializes i to 1. Inside the loop, it prints i and then increments i. The loop terminates when i is greater than 10, which occurs after 10 is printed. Program A prints 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10. Program B initializes i to 0. Inside the loop, it increments i and then prints i. The loop terminates when i equals 10, which occurs after 10 is printed. Program B prints 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10.

Q 17 - I picked option A, but option D is correct because version I calls the GetPrediction procedure once for each element of idList, or four times total. Since each call requires 1 minute of execution time, version I requires approximately 4 minutes to execute. Version II calls the GetPrediction procedure twice for each element of idList, and then again in the final display statement. This results in the procedure being called nine times, requiring approximately 9 minutes of execution time.

Q 26 - I picked option D, but option A is correct because the variable count is initially set to 0 and is incremented only when the current item in the list (represented by the variable n) equals the value of the variable target.

Q 36 - I picked option B, but option A is correct because digital data on the Internet is sent by breaking data into blocks of bits called packets. The packets are reassembled by the user’s computer.

Q 45 - I picked option B, but option C is correct because both code segments display the correct average. Code segment I requires more arithmetic operations because it performs the operation sum / LENGTH (numList) within the loop, while code segment II performs the same operation only once.
