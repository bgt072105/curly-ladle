## Finals Quiz 1
### Score: 46/50

### Test Corrections:

Q 20 - I picked option B, but option A was correct because when list1 and list2 are combined, the newList may have duplicates and will likely not be sorted. By performing the Sort and then the RemoveDuplicates procedures it is possible to create a list that is sorted, has no duplicates, and contains the names of all the books found in either list1 or list2.

Q 25 - I picked option A, but option C was correct because the Creative Commons license is designed to increase the amount of content available to the public for free which means that Statement I is correct. Furthermore, statement III is correct because under Creative Commons the author can stipulate what kind of modification is allowed by users.

Q 32 - I picked option B, but option C was correct because moving the statement in line 5 so that it appears between lines 2 and 3 would allow count to be initialized outside of the for loop.

Q 37 - I picked option B, but option D was correct because when x=3, y=2, and z=1 the program would not find the max to be 3, the value of x.
