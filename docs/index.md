## 5.1 Notes
* People create computing innovations that often are incorporated into the ways that they do certain tasks
* The effects of a particular computing innovation can not always be predicted beforehand
* Depending on different perspectives, a single effect of a computing innovation can be viewed as beneficial or harmful to different people or even a single person
* The original purpose of the World Wide Web was to rapidly and easily exchange information within the scientific community
* Targeted advertising is meant to help businesses but can be abused by individuals
* Machine learning and data mining have paved the way for innovation in medicine, business, and science but certain groups have been discriminated because of the information discovered through these methods

## 5.2 Notes
* Socioeconomic, geographic, and demographic characteristics as well as the country where an individual lives all play a role into an individual's ability to access the internet
* The "digital divide" refers the differing access to computing devices and the Internet across different individuals based on certain characteristics
* Affects both individuals and groups
* Raises issues of equity, access, and influence both globally and locally
* This divide is affected by the actions of individuals, organizations, and governments

## 5.1 Activity

Question 1:

* One innovation in computing that has led to both beneficial and harmful effects have been the creation of devices like Tile and Apple Airtags. Devices like these can be beneficial in the everyday lives of people by helping them to keep track of their belongings. A common use case for these devices is to attach them to key or leave them in a backpack. With these devices, if you were to lose the item that these devices are attached to you would be able to track these devices through an app on your phone to locate your item once again. Devices like these can be harmful when in the wrong hands though. For example, several news stories have reported on people being tracked by Apple Airtags, only to find out when their phones alerted them that they were being followed by an Airtag. Devices like these are easy to hide especially on something like a car. When abused, these devices have severe implications on the privacy of citizens and thus can be harmful.
* Another innovation in computing that has led to both beneficial and harmful effects have been the creation of smart speakers such as Google Home and Amazon Alexa. Devices like these can be beneficial in the everyday lives of people by allowing people to make simple requests such as a timer or by answering questions for people. Voice controlled devices like these are convenient since they allow the user to use them without doing anything more than simply talking to them. However, these devices can also be harmful since they have potentially harmful implication on the privacy of people. Users may not really know when their smart speakers are recording audio and thus encroaching on their privacy, hence making these computing innovations potentially harmful.
* One final innovation in computing that has led to both beneficial and harmful effects have been the creation of security cameras. Devices like these can be beneficial as they serve as a deterrent to thieves or other criminals and can also record criminal activity should it occur. This is obviously beneficial as these devices can be used to protect property. However, these devices can also be harmful because of the privacy implications that they entail. Security cameras are often connected to the internet so that they can be viewed by owners remotely, but this also means that hackers can hack into them and gain access to their video feed which is a huge privacy issue and something that is obviously harmful.

Question 2:

* Dopamine issues are something that is certainly real and not conspiracy and has been proven by science. Dopamine issues can have potentially detrimental effects on high schoolers and others by distracting them from more important things in their lives. High schoolers are busy enough with their lives as is with their school work and extracurricular activities. Adding in the dopamine associated with apps like Instagram, Tiktok, and Snapchat can lead to disastrous effects. The dopamine caused by these apps can cause high schoolers to waste significant amounts of their time on these apps rather than doing more productive things. I have personal experience with this as it always takes me longer to do my homework assingments when I have my phone next to me. When my phone is next to me I am always tempted to go on it and check various social media platforms, causes of dopamine. By separating myself from my phone when I need to be productive, I find that I can get my work done much more efficiently.

## 5.2 Acitivty

Question 1:

* Someone can empower themselves in a digital world by seeking out resources to access the internet, if they have the ability to. People can also empower themselves in a digital world by educating themselves on how to safely use the internet to avoid potential fraud or hackers. It is my personal belief that as we live in an increasingly digital world, it is vital for all people to learn how to stay safe on the internet. The ability to use the internet safely is a key step to someone becoming empowered in a digital world. Ultimately, it takes the correct resources for someone to become empowered in the digital world, and unfortunately as a result of the digital divide it is not possible for everyone to become empowered in the digital world. However, for people who are fortunate enough to have access to techonology and the internet, they can become empowered in the digital world by learning the ins and outs of how techonology works.

Question 2:

* Someone that is empowered in the digital world can help someone that is not empowered in the digital world by educating others or donating resources. Unfortunately, a digital divide exists which means that due to socioeconomic, geographic, or demographic based reasons, not everyone has equal opportunities to access technology and the internet. This digital divide can be reduced by people who have the means necesary by donating technology to the less fortunate. Another way for people who are empowered in the digital world to help someone that is not empowered is by educating them on how to use technology. People who are not empowered in the digital world may have access to technology and the internet, but just may not have the knowledge to use these tools effectively and safely. Someone who is empowered in the digital world can educate these other people on how to effectively and safely use technology and the internet, thus empowering people who were previously not empowered in the digital world. Something that could be done at Del Norte to is to hold seminars to educate people on how to effectively utilize their technology and possibly donate old computers to people in need of them.

Question 3:

* I would say that red tape is definitely blocking digital empowerment. Examples of red tape blocking digital empowerment at Del Norte include certain websites or applications being blocked on the school wifi network. These websites and applications could potentially be useful in the classroom and support the learning of students, but red tape is blocking access to these websites and applications. An example of red tape blocking digital empowerment elsewhere is the great firewall of China. The great firewall of China severely restricts the websites that people in China have access to, thus preventing people from becoming empowered in the digital world.
